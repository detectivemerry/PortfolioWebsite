    aboutDescription : "Full stack web developer and a recent 2023 computer science graduate from Nanyang Technological University (NTU). I enjoy bringing good ideas to life through full-stack development. I've developed several full-stack web applications in Javascript (using FERN stack) for school projects. I am currently going through the Odin Project course, brushing up my full-stack development fundamentals as well (Check my github for all the interesting mini projects I have done in the Odin Project!). \n I have done two internships. First internship was with Anacle Systems in 2022, where I collaborated on a research and design project to optimize loading time for search pages of the company’s software product by modifying the loading strategy implemented, resulting in a significant average speed improvement of 49%. The software product was an ASP .NET web application. \n Second internship was with Autodesk in 2023 -  I supported daily software reliability engineering operations using monitoring tools such as Splunk and Grafana. Developed tools and developed an automation library to enhance my team’s productivity for my internship project, using Python, Selenium library, Docker and Jenkins.",
    aboutDevelopmentSkill: "I am skilled with programming languages such as, Javascript, Python and C#, and hold a solid foundational understanding of Java and Go.\n Front-end development wise, I am skilled with HTML and CSS and have leveraged component libraries such as Material UI and Bootstrap in school projects. Additionally, I have a strong command of ReactJS, enabling me to create dynamic and interactive web applications.\n Back-end development wise, I have hands-on experience with technologies like Node.js, Express.js and ASP .NET Web API. I have used Firebase as a non-relational SQL database in school projects and Microsoft SQL Server during my first internship.\n Dev-ops wise, I have experience employing Docker and Jenkins to orchestrate seamless execution for my intern project. I have working knowledge of the deployment process from my internship, including automating Jenkins pipelines triggered by pull requests to ensure streamlined deployments.\n",
    aboutInterest: "I am passionate about getting better at my craft as a software engineer and everything technology related. I also like to learn things from other fields, such as the Immune system and world history, with the help of the internet and its interesting infographics (shoutout to Kurzgesagt and Crash Course!). My other hobbies include exercising, gaming and watching a wide variety of youtube videos.",
